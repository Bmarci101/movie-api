# Movie API

## Your First React App

This TW week will be about creating a React App on top of existing open APIs. Your task is to design and implement the frontend part of the project with multiple routes, data fetching, styled components and state management using React.

## General requirements

- Use React Hooks and Function Components, not the older, class-based ones
- Use axios, react-router-dom, styled-components, Context API, so everything you learnt on your SI week
- Push all code to GitHub, someone should create a repo and others can join
- Be brave, and experiment with different npm packages
- It's allowed to use React component libraries, like MaterialUI or Ant Design. Only for pros!
